# Vertikal Speed Indicator

DESCRIPTION

This is a simple mod which gives the player a quick reference to their vessel's current vertical speed by 
changing the colour of the NavBall text according to whether they are ascending or descending. 

When you are trying to manually land and reducing velocity, often newer players can 'overburn' which results 
in the speed switching to a positive figure (and the vessel lifts up again). Unfortunately, in stock, there is 
no indication as to which direction the velocity is being applied. Additionally, if the player has the SAS set to 
retrograde (as instructed in the tutorials), because the prograde/retrograde markers switch positions during such 
an event, the vessel can sometimes turn upside down and/or spin which a newer player (and some more experienced!) can 
struggle to recover from.

This mod addresses the above by changing the colour of the text to red (when descending) and green (standard) when 
ascending. Therefore, with practice, it's possible to manually land without locking the SAS to the retrograde marker. 
Additionally, this teaches the player fine throttle control as they get instant feedback on their adjustments whilst 
attempting to (for example) hover.

DETAILS

- the mod only affects the NavBall when in "Surface Mode". It doesn't change the colour when in "Orbit Mode" or 
  "Target Mode". Usually the game switches to "Surface Mode" as you are sub-orbital and slowing down but you can 
  of course manually change it by clicking on the speed.
  
-  In "Surface Mode" if your vessel is descending towards the ground, the text will turn red. If you are ascending, 
  it will turn green (the standard setting).
